                <p>Each of the events in track needs diffrent equipment.The runners on 
                the team need a pair of spiked cleats so they dont slip while running.They also
                have a starting block so they don't fall when they start.For the hurdlers they need hurdles
                to jump over and a pair of spiked cleats.Pole vaulters need their poles and they
                also need a crossbar to jump over plus the pit to land on.Throwers can either throw
                a shot put or discus  and they need a pair of throwing shoes.
